### Reflection

This was my first CAD assignment of the year, and I am happy to say that I had little to no problems getting back into it. 
I learned how to animate an assembly, how to view in a section view

### Reflection

This was a little trickier, since I had to use new and trickier tools such as sweeps and helix's. Overall, I am glad to now know how to properly use these new tools, and grateful that I succesfully finished the assignments.
