# Beyblade/Spinner

### Description

The main goal of this assignment is to create a spinner in a multi-part studio using instructions provided, and then answer questions on a Canvas quiz afterwards.

### Final Reflection

This was my first CAD assignment of the year, and I am happy to say that I had little to no problems getting back into it. 
I learned how to animate an assembly, how to view in a section view, and countless other useful tools that I will definitely put to use in the future. Before working on this assignment, I do not think that I fully understood the extent of which multi-part studios are so useful in contrast to an assembly.

## 4.1

##### 4.1 Reflection

This assignment was most definitely the easiest CAD assignment of the entire Spinner assignment. Only thing that I forgot about a little was merging added extrusions with previously existing parts to add a modification/new feature to a part. Other than that, the instructions were very straightforward and helped me finish my part for this assignent (The ring) in about five minutes.

##### 4.2 Reflection

This was a little trickier, since I had to use new and trickier tools such as sweeps and helix's. It was tricky to navigate the part studio and find the right things to connect / extrude etc, and since the whole part was not very angular and more curved and helical, it was a new challenge to create a part with features such as those of a propeller.

##### 4.3 Reflection

This part of the assignment was also relatively easy, with the only tricky part coming with sliding mates and revolve mates. From this assignment, I learned how to limit the extent that a sliding mate can go in either direction. I can imagine that that becomes very useful when creating assemblies that use multiple moving parts to create some sort of contraption.

##### 4.4/4.5 Reflection

The last part of this assignment was tricky, as I had to branch to create a new workspace in order to correctly fasten both the spinner and propellor together. The other tricky part was creating a rack and pinion relation, to then later get to the fun part, which was to animate the assembly in order tol fully visualize the functionality of the spinner and to see what it would look like when it all ended up working.

## Swing Arm

### Description

For this assignment I had to create a part for a swing arm out of stainless steel in Onshape using diagrams provided with dimensions (some of which later had to be configured as they were entered in as variables) and then mess around with the dimensions a little bit to answer questions based on the weight (in grams) of the part respective to the variable configurations configured in a variable table inside of the part studio.

### Reflection

It being my first time ever really having to 100% rely on a diagram to create a part from scratch. It was a tricky but fun process, and I learned many things. In this assignment I didn't really learn how to use any completely new tools but I learned more how to use tools which I already knew of in a smarter and more extensive way. Some examples of this would be the dimension tool, which I used to use so much that a sketch would would be completely filled with dimensions. Doing this assignment taught me how to use any of the constraint tools to minimize the amount of dimensions that are needed to be made.

## Multi-Part Design Studio

### Description

The purpose of this assignment was to basically accomplish the same thing as the above assignment, that being to be able to create a part from scratch by only using diagrams with dimensions and whatnot on them. The difference from this assignment to the last is that in this assignment it is not a single part that we're creating, but instead multiple parts, albeit still in a single part studio, a.k.a. a multi-part studio.

### Reflection

So far this year, this was definitely the most challenging of the CAD assignments. The reason for this is that it a. introduced new methods and tools to create parts, b. asked me to change dimensions without the use of a configuration table, and c. was not as clear as the last asignment in the diagrams. Still, I managed to complete the assignment with the help of some new tools, the most useful of which being the boolean tool, which enabled me to subtract elements of one part from another, to create a perfect fit between both parts.

**Certification Reflection:**

As preparation, I think it was a very good idea to take a few weeks out of the curriculum to work exclusively on CAD and Onshape. The best part about doing this in class is that there was always avaliable help from both teachers and students, and in may cases, me and Sophie worked together on some of the assignments in order to help us both understand. Retrospectively, I wish I would've worked more on Onshape assemblies, and especially limits. Another thing that I would've preferably spent more time on multi-part studio practice. It was by far the most complicated question on the test. As for tips on the test itself, I would say the best thing to do is to portion your time accordingly. Most important of all though is to set variables. The best way to do this is to look ahead in the doc they give you, to make sure of anything you have to change. All in all, it was a positive test-taking experience, and taught me a lot about how sometimes working smarter is much better than working harder.
