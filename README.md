# Beyblade/Spinner

### Description

The main goal of this assignment is to create a spinner in a multi-part studio using instructions provided, and then answer questions on a Canvas quiz afterwards.

### Final Reflection

This was my first CAD assignment of the year, and I am happy to say that I had little to no problems getting back into it. 
I learned how to animate an assembly, how to view in a section view, and countless other useful tools that I will definitely put to use in the future. Before working on this assignment, I do not think that I fully understood the extent of which multi-part studios are so useful in contrast to an assembly.

##### 4.1 Reflection

This assignment was most definitely the easiest CAD assignment of the entire Spinner assignment. Only thing that I forgot about a little was merging added extrusions with previously existing parts to add a modification/new feature to a part. Other than that, the instructions were very straightforward and helped me finish my part for this assignent (The ring) in about five minutes.

##### 4.2 Reflection

This was a little trickier, since I had to use new and trickier tools such as sweeps and helix's. It was tricky to navigate the part studio and find the right things to connect / extrude etc, and since the whole part was not very angular and more curved and helical, it was a new challenge to create a part with features such as those of a propeller.
